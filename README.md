Use Spotify to listen to songs by a musician or band directly from their Wikipedia page
This extension takes the name of the musician or band you are reading about on Wikipedia, and loads a Spotify music player with songs by that artist so you can listen to their music for free, right in the browser! Just click on the Spotipedia button when you are on a musician, band or singer's page on Wikipedia.org.

Millions of people use Wikipedia to learn about their favorite artists, and many use it to explore and discover other related artists in the world of music. Now, with Spotipedia for Chrome, you can actually LISTEN to the music of the artist you are reading about!

* You'll need the Spotify desktop app (FREE) to listen to the music. This can be downloaded by clicking on the Spotify link in the popup window. Spotify may not be available in all countries.
